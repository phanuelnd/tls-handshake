# TLS Handshake Simulation

This Node.js program simulates a simplified TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake process. It demonstrates the negotiation of TLS versions and cipher suites between a client and a server, as well as a basic representation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The simulation allows users to interactively choose TLS versions and cipher suites for both the client and server sides, providing insight into how these components work together in establishing a secure connection.

To run the simulation, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, and execute the command `node tls_handshake_simulation.js`. Follow the prompts to select TLS versions and cipher suites for the client and server. The program will then display the results of the handshake process, including the negotiated TLS version, selected cipher suite, and a simplified shared secret key.
